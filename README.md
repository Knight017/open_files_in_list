# Open Files In List

A simple Sublime Text plugin that will open files from a text list.  

**Usage**

Simply create a list of files in an active tab:

    C:\Users\Username\Desktop\temp\test file 1.txt
    C:\Users\Username\Desktop\temp\test file 2.txt
    C:\Users\Username\Desktop\temp\test file 3.txt
    C:\Users\Username\Desktop\temp\test file 4.txt
    C:\Users\Username\Desktop\temp\test file 5.txt

And run the `open_files_in_list` command. If the file is found, it will be opened in a new tab.  If the file is not found, the line for that file will be highlighted in the active tab so it's easy to tell which files weren't opened.
